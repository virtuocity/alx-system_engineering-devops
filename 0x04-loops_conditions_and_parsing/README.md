# 0x04. Loops, conditions and parsing
## Notes 
Run the following command to create an SSH key pair. You can leave the passphrase blank if you do not wish to  "unlock" your key each time you use it:   

    ssh-keygen -t rsa 

    if [ test_condition ] 
    then
    consequent_commands
    fi


loops start with do and ends with done
### man sed 
Name
sed - stream editor for filtering and transforming text

Synopsis
sed [OPTION]... {script-only-if-no-other-script} [input-file]...

Description
Sed is a stream editor. A stream editor is used to perform basic text transformations on an input stream (a file or input from a pipeline). While in some ways similar to an editor which permits scripted edits (such as ed), sed works by making only one pass over the input(s), and is consequently more efficient. But it is sed's ability to filter text in a pipeline which particularly distinguishes it from other types of editors.
