# 0x06-regular_expressions
## Notes
*Super classic industry joke*   
Some people, when confronted with a problem, think
“I know, I'll use regular expressions.”   Now they have two problems.  
**A regular expression**, commonly called a *“regexp”*, is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern.  It is mainly for use in pattern matching with strings, or string matching (i.e. it operates like a “find and replace” command)   
One thing you have to be careful with is that different languages use different regexp engines. That means that a regexp in Python, for example, will be interpreted differently in Javascript.   
System administrators and DevOps are the ones using them the most because they are very handy for log parsing.  
You can think of regular expressions as wildcards on steroids. You are probably familiar with wildcard notations such as *.txt to find all text files in a file manager. The regex equivalent is ^.*\.txt$.
