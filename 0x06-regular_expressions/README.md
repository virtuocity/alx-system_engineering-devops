# 0x06-regular_expressions
## Notes
*Super classic industry joke*   
Some people, when confronted with a problem, think
“I know, I'll use regular expressions.”   Now they have two problems.  
**A regular expression**, commonly called a *“regexp”*, is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern.  It is mainly for use in pattern matching with strings, or string matching (i.e. it operates like a “find and replace” command)
